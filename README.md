3.  Conclusion
As far as we worked at this project, we realized that we had to work in real 
projects to be a good programmer. This was a great experience for us to upgrade our 
code knowledge and team work. We face with many problems in this project and we 
can easily can handle with this problems. As you know, we have only two team member 
and ito was really hard and enjoyable at the same time. Of course, we still can have 
problems in program, but there is no program that not includes any bug.
